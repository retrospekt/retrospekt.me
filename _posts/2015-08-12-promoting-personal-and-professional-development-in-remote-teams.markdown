From yoga classes and cooking lessons to language courses, educational stipends and paid sabbaticals - the promise of opportunities for personal and professional growth is now part of every top employer’s benefits package. At the same time, investing in the lifelong learning of employees has become more than just a set of cool perks used to attract great and increasingly demanding talent. In the fast-paced world of startups and tech, promoting personal and professional development within an organization is crucial to remaining successful, profitable, and most importantly, competitive.

> If your business isn't learning, then you're going to fall behind. And a business learns as its people learn.

More and more employers have come to realize this challenge, [devoting considerable resources](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2014/02/04/the-recovery-arrives-corporate-training-spend-skyrockets/) to satisfy the increasing demand for personal and professional growth. Today, there are a variety of ways in which companies can organize and deliver continuous learning opportunities that nurture their most important asset - their employees.

For distributed teams, however, the solutions are not as straightforward. Just as employee perks do not always translate well from local to remote, providing personal and professional development opportunities poses its own challenges in the context of the remote workplace. On-site gyms and in-house Spanish lessons may not be feasible, but there are several options for remote startups to level the playing field:

### Provide the right set of tools

Some remote startups have gone so far as to make personal development [part of their company culture](https://open.bufferapp.com/buffer-values/) and they employ a number of tools to ensure their team continues to learn and grow. [Buffer](https://open.bufferapp.com/buffer-perks-startup-perks/), for example, offers employees a Jawbone UP to encourage improving one’s physical fitness, as well as free Kindle books for intellectual stimulation.

Subscriptions and full access to online learning platforms such as [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) and [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/), on the other hand, are excellent incentives for employees to hone existing skills and to further master their craft.

### Develop a mentoring program

Sometimes the best resources for professional growth come from within the organization itself. Mentoring can act as a compliment to any of the above while at the same time creating a special bond between members of the team, formed over shared experiences and challenges. A successful mentoring program promotes the development of employees who can be part of and carry on the company culture.

While mentoring is a serious commitment and can [prove difficult](http://firstround.com/review/Heres-Why-Youre-Not-Hiring-the-Best-and-the-Brightest/) to implement in a remote working environment, this shouldn’t keep teams from trying. Even if they find that they’re unable to establish an effective mentoring program, the process itself will prove its worth as they [learn as a team](http://www.helpscout.net/blog/team-learning-culture/) to the benefit of the company.

### Encourage event participation

Conferences, workshops, hackathons are all fantastic ways for anyone to get involved with the community in their field, exchange ideas, pick up new skills, and do a healthy dose of IRL networking. [Automattic](https://automattic.com/work-with-us/) is one remote employer offering stipends and reimbursements specifically for attending these kinds of events.

It may be tempting to use company retreats for the above purposes, but it's better to let these gatherings do what they do best, i.e. build and strengthen relationships within the team. It's ultimately more beneficial to instead promote continuous learning by encouraging and funding participation in relevant activities and events.

> Those people who develop the ability to continuously acquire new and better forms of knowledge [...] will be the movers and shakers in our society for the indefinite future.

The above are just three options for remote startups to develop a culture of continuous learning within their teams. Promoting personal and professional growth opportunities like these will pay off not only in employee happiness, retention and loyalty, but also in increased competitiveness and the future success of the business.
